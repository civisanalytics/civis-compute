# Examples for using civis-compute

See the examples for how you can use `civis-compute`!

1. Zombies! - [zombie.py](zombie.py)
2. Fitting the Iris Dataset - [iris.py](iris.py)
3. Fitting the Fashion-MNIST Dataset w/ TensorFlow and a Notebook - [fashion_mnist.ipynb](fashion_mnist.ipynb)
   This example depends on the file [cnn.py](cnn.py) which contains a
   scikit-learn-compatible convolutional neural network classifier built off of
   our package [muffnn](https://github.com/civisanalytics/muffnn).
